When using it you will get 3 choices/stages:

1. Fix, to fix any corrupted Windows files and to scan for viruses.

2. Debloat, to remove all the bloatware in Windows 11 or 10.

3. Optimize, to apply registery tweaks and to optimize Windows's settings.

If you want to use to source code, be sure to run the optimizer.py file in the same directory as the "Data" folder.

You can review the code and suggest new features or report a bug, to make the optimizer better, follow me and send a feedback.
